## Project Overview
This project is a simple React application built with Vite that allows users to create and display colored boxes of specified dimensions. Users can input the width, height, and background color for each box, and the application dynamically renders these boxes on the screen. Each box also has a "remove" button that will call a remove function to delete the target box. The project demonstrates the use of React components, state management, and form handling.

2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the dependencies using npm
